# Linux and Git

## Linux

---

### The command line:

- text interface with basic abilities:
    - manipulate files
    - launch programs
    - manage system resources
- UNIX-like command-line
    - defines what kind of commands can be run(`ls`, `cd`, ...)
- many alernatives
    - default command line on Linux is `bash`
    - MacosX has `zsh: `
    - under Windows:
        - Git Bash (gets installed automatically with Git)
        - Windows Linux Subsystem: you can add the Linux kernel to windows...
        - if you use Julia, typing `;` in the console switches it to bash mode
- to follow this lecture you need:
    - *any* UNIX-like shell to provide basic commands
    - git

---

### Basic commands

- most command line commands take the form `command argument1 argument2`
- some accept options like
    - `-h`: one letter option (`-h` usually means help)
    - `--h`: multi-letter option
    - `-o param`: option taking some parameter
    - `--option=parameter`: option taking some paramter
- you can get documentation on a given command
    - by typing `man doc`. That one is verbose but very detailed
    - by googling...
- some commands accept wildcards:
    - `ls late*done` will list all files starting with `late` and ending in `done`

---

### Basic commands

- basic file management commands:
    - `pwd`: show current directory
    - `cd path`: changes the current directory to "`path`"
    - `cd ~` goes to the home folder
    - `ls` list files in the current directory 
    - `rmdir dir`: deletes a directory `dir`
    - `rm filename` deletes a file
        - `rm -rf dir` removes a directory and its content (DOUBLE-CHECK)
    - `cat filename` prints the name of a file `filename
    - `touch filename` creates a new, empty file
    

??? note
    In the Unix world, the root of the file system is denoted by `/` (a slash). Folders are separated by slashes and the last element is a file). For instance `/home/pablo/file.txt`.

    In the Windows world the root is usually a hard drive denoted by a letter and a colon (typically `C:`). Then folders are separated by an anteslash `\` like in `C:\Users\Pablo\Documents\file.txt`. Note that in most places Windows also accept slashes. If you copy and paste the adress of a windows directory in a Linux bash it typicall works as long as it's a windows machine. For instance in git bash you can do: `cd "C:\Users\Pablo\Documents\file.txt"` (we double quote the string otherwise `\` is intepreted as an escape character)

---

## Version Control

---

### What is under version control?

- Keeps history of all modifications for:
    - the content of a directory
    - all files staged for VCS
- Can switch the content of a directory to:
    - a past version (a past commit)
    - a version written by a collaborator (a commit on another branch)
- Can merge the work done concurrently (merge commits from different branches)

---

### Diff

- How can one track modifications between in a directory in two successive states?
    - watch for new/deleted/renamed files
    - compute the difference between the content of a given file in two different states (a `diff`)

---

### Diff: Example

Type the following instructions (you can use a text editor to edit the files instead):

- create a new, empty file: `touch file.txt`
- write a few lines in this file: `echo "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4" > file.txt`
    - "\n" means end of line under Linux
    - `echo` writes its argument to the pipe `>` writes the pipe to a file
- look a the original file `cat file.txt`
``` linenums="1"
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
```
- change one of the line and write the result in another file: `sed '2 c Line 1a' file.txt > newfile.txt`
- look at the resulting file: `cat newfile.txt`
``` linenums="1"
Line 1
Line 1a
Line 3
Line 4
```
- compute the change and store the result in patch: `diff -u file.txt newfile.txt > patch`
    - option `-c` instructs the `diff` program to add contextual information which creates a more verbose patch and also one that is more robust to changes in the original file
- look at the patch: `cat patch`:
```diff linenums="1"
--- newfile_from_patch.txt      2020-05-05 12:38:12.498602372 +0200
+++ newfile.txt 2020-05-06 11:17:38.938087155 +0200
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 Line 1
-"Line 1a"
- Line 3
+Line 1a
+Line 3
+Line 4
```

    - content is self-explanatory

- now apply the patch to create a new file with the same modification: `patch -i patch -u file.txt -o newfile_from_patch.txt`
    - this applies the changes included in input (`-i`) file `patch`...
    - assuming input is in the universal format (`-u`)
    - to file `file.txt`
    - to produce `newfile_from_patch.txt`
- we can check both files are identical: `cat newfile_from_patch.txt` and `cat newfile.txt` are identical
    - `cat newfile_from_patch.txt`
``` linenums="1"
Line 1
Line 1a
Line 3
Line 4
```
    - or `diff newfile.txt newfile_from_patch.txt`

### From diff to git history

- To record history Git stores differences between successive revisions.
- Current revision from an older revision by applying recursively all modifications that happened since.
- The action of storing a revision, i.e. computing the `diff` which defines it is called a commit.
- One can represent all past commits of a given revision as a one branch tree.

---

### From diff to git history: example

- Let's create an empty directory and do some version control in it:
    - `mkdir linear_history`
    - `cd linear_history`
    - `git init`: start versioning in it by creating an empty git repository. This creates a hidden `.git` folder which will store all the git history
- Create a new, empty file: `touch file.txt`
- Make some edits `echo "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4" > file.txt`
- Check the status: `git status`
    ```
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

            file.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```
- Put this file under version control: `git add file.txt`
- Now `git status` records the fact there is a file under version control whose modifications have not been recorded.
    ```
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   file.txt
    ```
- Commit this modifications: `git commit -a -m "Created file.txt"`

    ```
    [master (root-commit) cb39aac] Created file.txt
     1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 file.txt
    ```

    - note the commit message which helps our future selves understand what's going on
    - this records a new revision, identified by commit number `cb39aac`

- Let's make some more modifications: `sed -i '2 c Line 1a' file.txt`
    - `-i` stands for inplace modifications
- Commit them `git commit -a -m "Changed line 2"`(no need to add `file.txt` as it is already under version control)
- Let's do some more edits: `sed -i '3 c Line 2' file.txt > newfile.txt`
- And commit them `git commit -a -m "Changed line 3"`
- Now we can look at the history: `git log`

    ```
    commit 9a320760c874c7f8bf25e89d2077d4525c5f8e45 (HEAD -> master)

    commit 03e2c8ca95170a413d3c0aa84fc940c66ac2cfe3

    Date:   Wed May 6 12:15:21 2020 +0200

        Created file.txt

    ```

    - Now we have nice history.

- We can see what happened since a particular commit: `git diff HEAD 03e2c8ca95170a413d3c0aa84fc940c66ac2cfe3`
    ```diff
    diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
    index f36933c..e579141 100644
    --- a/file.txt
    +++ b/file.txt
    @@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
     Line 1
    -Line 1a
     Line 2
    +Line 3
     Line 4
    ```

- Now look back at the  "HEAD" word in the git log: it means that our directory is currently synchronized with the latest commit. Indeed the content of `file.txt` is the result from all edits (check `cat file.txt`). Let's explore the past, we copy the commit number of the first modification and check it out: `git checkout 03e2c8ca95170a413d3c0aa84fc940c66ac2cfe3`

    ```
    Note: checking out '03e2c8ca95170a413d3c0aa84fc940c66ac2cfe3'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

      git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

    HEAD is now at 03e2c8c Created file.txt
    ```

    - `cat file.txt` shows that the file has reverted to its former state

    ``` linenums="1"
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    Line 4
    ```

    - note that from the message above, you are in "detached mode": if you make modifications, they would conflict with the actual history wouldn't they ? You can make them but they will be discarded when you go back to the most revision. That is unless you save them in a branch. (in the next slide)

- Let's go back to the latest revision and check everything is normal: `git checkout master` and `git log`
    - here `master` is the name of the default branch and `git checkout master` means "go to latest commit on master branch". We cold also have done `git checkout 9a320760c874c7f8bf25e89d2077d4525c5f8e45`

### Merging files

- So far we have seen how to record revison history. This is already quite useful but on the tip of the git iceberg.

- What happens if, starting from a given file, we make concurrent modifications ? Can we merge them together ?
    - if two people edit different files no problem: just keep the two of them
    - if two people edit the same file, we have a merge issue

---

### Merging files (example)

Consider the following story. Mr A writes a file `text` with the following content (to tell the truth he used a lorem ipsum generator):

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Duis ac tristique erat.
Nullam et lorem dignissim sem efficitur fringilla a eget justo. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos.
In maximus diam ac lorem aliquam, nec mollis nunc vehicula. Fusce sodales est eget risus imperdiet, a rhoncus nunc malesuada.
Nulla dapibus magna nibh, ac rutrum lorem viverra quis.
```

He then asks two collaborators B and C to propose modifications. B proposes `text_B` (he used google translate some of A's text):

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Duis ac tristique erat.
relais de football Lorem et une salade de thérapie écologique besoin.
Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos.
In maximus diam ac certains lorem, nec mollis nunc vehicula. Fusce sodales est eget risus imperdiet, a rhoncus nunc malesuada.
Nulla dapibus magna nibh, ac rutrum lorem viverra quis.
```

Just before the deadline, C proposes `text_C`:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Duis ac tristique erat.
Nullam et lorem dignissim sem efficitur fringilla a eget justo. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos.
In maximus diam ac algunos lorem, nec mollis nunc vehicula. Fusce sodales est eget risus imperdiet, a rhoncus nunc malesuada.
Nulla dapibus nibh, ac rutrum lorem viverra quis.
```

What should Mr A do ?

- He can compte the changes (diff) proposed by B and C:
    - by B `diff -u text text_B > patch_B`

    ```diff linenums="1"
    --- text        2020-05-06 13:02:43.006841045 +0200

- Now he can see that B and C are proposing to change different lines, except the one starting with "In maximus" that they both want to change. He can then keep the change from both of them.
- In practice he uses a merging tool (like meld)
    - TODO: include screenshot

<!-- ## Branches in git

The ability to merge several modifications allows us to keep several sets of concurrent modifications. 

- Take the former example: `cd

--- -->


## Workflows

Instructions to follow the course:

Here is the goal:
- each student A must be able to update its online copy of the main repository from professor
- he can share his work by pushing to a branchin his own online repository (aka fork)

One challenge, is that jupyter notebooks are not really appropriate for merging modifications (it's not a source format).

Hence it is suggested students do not work directly on the files from the github repository but on a copy.

Here is the basic workflow:

1. `git clone https://github.com/albop/eco309.git` to get a copy of the main repository (do it only once)
    - it will be referred as `origin`
2. add your fork as another remote: `git add remote fork https://github.com/EconForge/eco309.git`
  - replace EconForge by your github login
  - the fork will be referred to as `fork`
3. copy a file like `cp 1_Optimization_tutorial.ipynb 1_Optimization_tutorial_mycopy.ipynb` 
  - work on the copy
4. put the copy under version control: `git add 1_Optimization_tutorial_mycopy.ipynb` (only once per file)
5. commit your changes with a message `git commit -a -m "Edited optimization"`
6. push them to the branch in the fork you own: `git push fork`

When there is an update in the main repository you can get them with `git pull origin`. Then you continue with steps 3,4,5,6.
